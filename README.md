# Homelab

This project is split into different directories depending on each service used.

## Requirements

To use this, you'll need the following installed on your sysetm

- kubectl
- helmfile
- helm
- git

## helm

This directory is used to store the helm configuration of the node and is managed using [helmfile](https://github.com/helmfile/helmfile), which is a declarative spec for defining helm charts.

To install this on your cluster, you can simply use the following command.

```
helmfile apply
```

## kustomize

Kustomize allows you to manage multiple manifest files in a `Kustomize.yaml`, which also allows you to override values if you need to.

I don't use Kustomize that much in the video, but it's a tool I do often use and is available in `kubectl`.
